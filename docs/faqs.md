# FAQs

## Any profit?

For now, no. In the future, there might be. After we solved this problem correctly, two further valuable services might emerge. Read [more](/faqs?id=is-there-any-profit).

## Why in English?

The result and method of this project need to be a contribution to the whole world, not only being used locally in China. Read [more](/faqs?id=why-do-you-document-in-english).

## Do you know the disadvantages of open sourcing?

Yes, I do. Open source means I cannot sell it, cannot sweep it, and cannot control it. Read [more](/faqs?id=do-you-know-the-disadvantages-of-open-sourcing-1).

## Can you share Tetra Pak's machine manuals?

Tetra Pak produces invaluable manuals such as maintenance and spare parts catalogs. They are not mine, but Tetra Pak's, so there is no meaning with the word "sharing." Read [more](/faqs?id=can-you-share-tetra-pak39s-machine-manuals-1).

## Why do you think you can succeed this time?

I had the experience, and I have some new data. Read [more](/faqs?id=why-do-you-think-you-can-succeed-this-time-1).

## What help do you need?

I beg for three things: time, data, and eyes. So be patient and watch me. If you have some advice, I am glad to hear it. Read more.

## Are you re-inventing wheels?

Yes and no. Yes, Tetra Pak had solved this problem decades ago, while nobody could refer to this core knowledge from outside, so I am re-inventing this wheel with new open-source tools publicly. Read more.

## Is there any profit? {docsify-ignore}

For now, no. In the future, there might be. After we solved this problem correctly, two further valuable services might emerge. 

One is technical support for dairy or other industry. If a man in charge found this project's approach and result, he would turn up the opportunity of fabricating A3 Flex similar machines. As far as I know, after my remodeling of the drive and jaw system, and co-working with SJTU for years, PLS bolt a used Tetra Pak A3-Flex machine from Hongkong two and a half years ago. 

The other is an educational example for mechanical engineering schools and junior engineers. Students have textbooks but lack practical problems. If they are excited as we do in this project, both the teacher (as my classmates are) and the students would like to donate their resource to make this affair sustainable.

## Why do you document in English?{docsify-ignore}

There are three reasons which push me - a native Chinese - use English in this project's documentation.

First, English has been accepted worldwide, and now most young Chinese can read and write some English, no matter how fluently. Therefore, using English instead of Chinese wouldn't bother the non-native English speaking people too much. By reading well written English, I could write more readable English.

Second, the result and method of this project need to be a contribution to the whole world, not only being used locally in China, which means higher standards to present the project. It must meet both the moral and professional rules, and I hope it maintains open to competing worldwide.

Third, it is convenient for me to post on FreeCAD's forum that I copy and paste documents from here to there. I want to discuss something with the developers, so I had better think like them, talk like them, and work like them. Since English communication is a must, then why not document in English throughout.

## Do you know the disadvantages of open sourcing? {docsify-ignore}

Yes, I do. Open source means I cannot sell it, cannot sweep it, and cannot control it.

I cannot sell the result of this project to the dairy industry, because they do not need to pay for something that anyone can get freely. 

I cannot close the project secretly, because the Internet has memory and keeps a record of every page. If I have to, I have to close it publicly with a legitimate reason.

I cannot control the variant of this project, because anyone interested in it can fork to his repository and build a variant version, declaring it his own and even selling it out. 

There is no patent system on Github, we believe in the power of open source itself. 

Once open source, it benefits from accumulation effects. We are building on the shoulder of giants and are ready to support others' legs. There might be less inventing, losing, and reinventing circles. 

Once open source, it benefits from outsiders effects. There might be strangers finding us, joining us, and helping us to do a better job. You never get any surprises if you keep working silently.

Once open source, it benefits from promising effects. We are announcing that we are doing this, aiming at that. To make a real difference to this world, we ask ourselves to obey disciplines and answer questions, which we don't need to care if it is only a personal exercise.

## Can you share Tetra Pak's machine manuals? {docsify-ignore}

Tetra Pak produces invaluable manuals such as maintenance and spare parts catalogs. They are not mine, but Tetra Pak's, so there is no meaning with the word "sharing."

I know it is illegal, but it may be an unsaid secret that almost everyone in the aseptic dairy industry has some copies of Tetra Pak's manuals, through the route of benefit sharing relationship: Tetra Pak's R&D to field engineers, to customers' operators, to supply chain's engineers, and to me, the localizing R&D engineer. We need each others' help, and we trust each other in selling no one out: we don't know who give the resources to our friend, because we don't ask. I won't bring trouble to myself in making sure there is no trouble to my friend who is still in the dairy industry. 

Sorry, you can get nothing about Tetra Pak's unique materials except some dimensions and sketches which I reproduced.

## Why do you think you can succeed this time? {docsify-ignore}

I divide this question into two parts: why it is me not other people to do the job and what's the difference this time.

Why it is me not other professional engineers to do the job? First, I have experience in the dairy machine industry and have an emotional motivation to solve this problem. Second, I have time as a freelancer with good ability, energy, and supports. Third, to make a living, it is my only, or my best, exit to make a leaving from the state of working in the library back to the state of working in the field.

What's the difference between seven years ago and today? First, the production relationship is different. In the past, I had a manager and a boss, who asked me to do some work and paid me. Today, I choose what to do and figure out how to do it, while the result can find its bosses on the open market. Second, the tools are different. In the past, I use Solidworks, Excel, Adams, and Scilab. Today, I use open source FreeCAD and Python, which included much better-documented projects and libraries. Third, the most important thing is the different data. In the past, I have only one group of point positions of Tetra Pak's TBA9 cam profile measured by the 3-coordinate machine. Today, I have a chart of acceleration curves of Tetra Pak's A3-Flex machine's servo-motor cams, which tell me more information about how the system behaves and set a goal to check my results.

The probability that I can succeed this time is much higher than other people, and than in the past time, due to both the personal and objective reasons mentioned above. 

## How do you define the success of this project? {docsify-ignore}

There are six goals in three aspects to measure the success of this project.

First, talk in the aspect of data. It is necessary to draw similar curves to Tetra Pak's acceleration curve with definite math expressions, which means to know why and know how to describe the behaviors of the two sets of cam actions. As for this particular problem, production flexibility is one of the objectives, so the result of different product shapes need to be tested by animations and simulations, and proved to be practical.

Second, talk in the aspect of society. This project is not truly public if nobody cares about it. Supposing at least three contributors joined in, it would be my honor. Meanwhile, this project is not practical if the industry has no interests in it. Supposing at least three companies accepted my interview or even invited me to discuss technology, I would be very pleased.

Third, in the aspect of documentation. It is better to write inline documents sufficiently, such as no less than 40% of the total codes, and better to cope more of the codes with testing cases, such as no less than 60% of the total codes. At the end period of this project, I would gather approaches and data together to form an ebook, as academic as graduate thesis, and as practical as recipe tutorial.

The data and the documentation aspects are relatively more accessible than the society part, which I cannot control myself.

## If this project failed finally, what were the reasons? {docsify-ignore}

There are many reasons to end this project, such as I won a lottery, or I found nobody needs it, or Tetra Pak sued me for trying to reverse-engineer their mechanism. That's just joking. Seriously speaking, I see three significant risks that cause this project to fail.

First, it is too hard for my ability to solve this problem technically because I lack the knowledge of mathematics and programming. 

Second, it is too long a time for my family to let me swimming on this problem without any incomes. I need to sell my time for other profitable projects.

Third, it is too dull for my spirit to focus on this issue, and I turn to other impressive technology and try to fetch other chances, leaving this problem with an open ending.

Among those three significant risks, the third one has the highest possibility.

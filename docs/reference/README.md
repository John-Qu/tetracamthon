# Information of technical details

I would like to quote this here to remind myself.

> A reference guide:
>
> - is **information-oriented**
> - describes the machinery
> - is accurate and complete
>
> *Analogy: a reference encyclopedia article*

from Daniele Procida's blog "[What nobody tells you about documentation](https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/)".

# Mechanism of Jaw Unit

## Example Source

This two sets of four cams mechanism are from Tetra Pak's A3-Flex filling machines' jaw system.

Here is a video in 10 seconds, showing how these movements actually work.

### Detail Description

There are two sets of jaws' movement in the process of forming the brick package, a left side, and a right side. Generally speaking, when the left side jaws are pulling package tube, the right jaws are returning from downside upward to clap the upside of the new package. Therefore, to form a uniform looking package and keep the tube moving smoothly, the two sets of jaws need to cooperate just in time and place; meanwhile, four actions in both sides which constitute the forming and pulling process must obey specific rules. How to program these rules into hard or soft cams is the goal of this project.

The four actions mentioned above are:

1. York slides upward and downward;
2. Jaws rock open and close;
3. Folding Flaps turn loose and tight.
4. Volume flaps sway open and hold;

Cam profile controls mechanism movement. Actual movements sometimes need to be cooperating. These cooperations can be complicated in two aspects. In space relationships, movement A and B let mechanism C behave like this D at place E, and movement F lets mechanism G behave like that H at placement J, while these two behaviors D and H affects the same objective K. In time relationships, movements A and B must consider the effects of mechanism G at one time and also consider the effects of mechanism C at another time, while this kind of consideration is not only in placements but also in velocities.

# Vision, Goal, and Approach

## Motivation

Let it no longer a bottleneck at the cam profiles of Tetra Pak's Filling Machines in either copying or re-inventing efforts.

## Goals

### Similarity

  Provide acceleration curves like the ones generated by Tetra Pak's engineers.

### Smoothness

  Draw smooth curves with a definitive specification to the continuity of acceleration up to jerk.

### Flexibility

  Generate cams profiles for other size and shape of packages.

### Validatability

  Prove to be practical and productive.

### Documentation

  Take note of everything.

## Approaches

### Open-source tools: 
  - FreeCAD v.s. Adams,
  - Python v.s. Matlab, and
  - LibreCAD v.s. AutoCAD.
  
### Real information: 
  - Tetra Pak's data as reference, and
  - industrial opinions as direction.
  
### Different stages: 
  - general curve then partial correction, 
  - geometrical sketches and then parametrical models, 
  - readme-like documentation and then detail completion.

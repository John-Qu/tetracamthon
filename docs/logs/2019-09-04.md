### Integrate to velocity and placement. 

OK.

Use cumulation integration function.

### Adjust the curve in order to make the velocity curve meet at the start and end points.

OK.

Adjust the acceleration raw data, and then zeros. 

The velocity data meet at start and end. The difference between the last two points and the first two points, their sum is nearly equal to the difference between the second first and the second last.

### Get the peak points.

OK.

High point at 84 degree, meaning the data is for TPA250Sq QC,  TPA330Sq, and TBA 200 M QC.

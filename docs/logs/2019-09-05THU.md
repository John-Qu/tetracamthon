## Make jerk curve from acceleration data

Use np.diff()

It is the adjacent two data. Because the original Bspline's control points are picked by hand, the data at each degrees is not so smooth.

If I interpolate these 360 points again with polynomials, I don't think it would help, enless the curve is not on those points exactly.

The result is here.

This placement curve is derived from acceleration curve as in the presentation slide of *metodi-strumenti-calcolo-prototipaz.pdf* at page 56 of 87.

This description is derived from Tetra Pak's document as *A3-Flex-MM-81748-0110.pdf* at page: 605 of 1588.

I need the package dimensions, in order to derive the relationship between the curves and the forming process.

### Estimate package dimensions

Got a picture of TPA 250 Sq from web.

Get the b:a ratio = 3.243

![](https://tva1.sinaimg.cn/large/006y8mN6ly1g6omuh4472j30u012bwwl.jpg)

250 ml = a^2 * b

if b:a = 3.243:

then a=42.56, b=138

330 ml = a^2 * b

if b=176

then a = 43.3

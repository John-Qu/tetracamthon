# Step Goals

## General Goal

The goal **IS** to understand more with a practical approach, which includes:

1. Designing curves of cam profile;
2. Calculating dimensions of critical mechanism ;
3. Record approaches to solving the problem.

The goal **IS NOT** to copy, to reinvent wheels, or to learn something, which means:

1. Not to build Tetra Pak's machine models;
2. Not to apply a patent just different (no better) from the original ones;
3. Not to become an expert of cams by reading through or translating cam design handbooks.

## Road Map

As far as I understand, the major milestones are as follows.

1. Describe the project and problem specifications.
2. Draw mechanism skeleton with critical conditional dimensions.
3. Analyze mechanism velocity and acceleration with forwarding and backward relationships.
4. Specify control points in "s.v.a." chart.
5. Design single cam curve.
6. Alliance two cam profiles movements to test the cooperating effect.
7. Redesign cam curves with several movements.
8. Test the result of performance.

They depend on each other's processes and need to be refined after being tested by their following processes.

# Welcome to Tetracamthon!

The **Four(tetra) Cam Mechanisms designed with Python and FreeCAD** - or **Tetracamthon** for short - is a pubic practice of mechanical knowledge and programming skill with a practical problem in Tetra Pak's [filling machine](). 

## Mission

To find an approach to reverse-engineer multiple cams which cooperate in placement and velocity to form one product.

Tetra Pak had solved this problem decades ago. However, nobody could refer to this knowledge from outside, so re-inventing this wheel with free tools publicly should draw an end to such wonder.

The result may be useful for dairy machinery industry, but the motivation of this documentation is arming at a tutorial for young engineers, who are curious about new tools and new profession.

### Tetracamthon Notebook

This repository is a notebook about how to design four(**tetra**) coupling **cam**s mechanisms with Py**thon** and FreeCAD, especially in Tetra Pak's A3-CompactFlex Filling machine's jaw and drive units as an example.

# Welcome to Tetracamthon!

The **Four Cam Mechanisms designed with Python and FreeCAD** - or **Tetracamthon** for short - is a pubic practice of mechanical knowledge and programming skill with a practical problem in the [filling machine]() as Tetra Pak have done well.

### Mission Statement

To find an approach to reverse-engineer multiple cams which cooperate in placement and velocity to form one product.

Cam profile controls mechanism movement. Actual movements sometimes need to be cooperating. These cooperations can be complicated in two aspects. In space relationships, movement A and B let mechanism C behave like this D at place E, and movement F lets mechanism G behave like that H at placement J, while these two behaviors D and H affects the same objective K. In time relationships, movements A and B must consider the effects of mechanism G at one time and also consider the effects of mechanism C at another time, while this kind of consideration is not only in placements but also in velocities.

### Tetracamthon Notebook

This repository is a notebook about how to design four(**tetra**) coupling **cam**s mechanisms with Py**thon** and FreeCAD, especially in Tetra Pak's A3-CompactFlex Filling machine's jaw and drive units as an example. 

If you find a problem or something that you'd like to dispute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/John-Qu/tetracamthon/issues/new). You can learn more about this notebook [here](notebook-structure.md).

# Welcome to Tetracamthon!

### What is Tetracamthon?

- a personal **practice**, solving an old problem with new data and insights 
- a practical **problem**, re-inventing a core wheel which many wonders around
- a public **project**, documenting nearly everything as an example of free tools

### What does "tetracamthon" mean?

- **tetra**: four, as in tetramerous, tetragram, tetrode, especially in Tetra Pak's classical [four faces package](https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-classic-aseptic)
- **cam**: a special shape of mechanical part(not necessary) which controls the movement of followers according to a specific function
- **thon**: a part of Python, indicating all the tools are based on Python like open source libraries.

### Where is the problem?

- In Tetra Pak's [A3/flex filling machine](https://www.tetrapak.com/packaging/tetra-pak-a3flex), jaw system is driven by servo motors whose programs is unable to download.
- In the servo motors' programs, there are several key positions at which two or more action affect the production and packages. 
- For various shape and size packages, the programs should vary with lest critical parts exchanged.

### What are the results?

- data and profile of four cams, and dimensions of exchangeable parts
- functions that generate those data, and scripts that draw the profiles of those data
- documentation of those functions and the process of writing these function

### Detail Description

There are two sets of jaws' movement in the process of forming the brick package, a left side, and a right side. Generally speaking, when the left side jaws are pulling package tube, the right jaws are returning from downside upward to clap the upside of the new package. Therefore, to form a uniform looking package and keep the tube moving smoothly, the two sets of jaws need to cooperate just in time and place; meanwhile, four actions in both sides which constitute the forming and pulling process must obey specific rules. How to program these rules into hard or soft cams is the goal of this project.

The four actions mentioned above are:

1. York slides upward and downward;
2. Jaws rock open and close;
3. Volume flaps sway open and hold;
4. Folding Flaps turn loose and tight.

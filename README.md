# Tetracamthon

## Introduction

This is a revers engineering work, generating cam profiles for Tetra Pak's 
A3 Flex/CompactFlex aseptic filling machine.

## Data

The original chart is from a ppt which engineers in Tetra Pak released on 2010
 for a conference.

## Result

Curves for different type of packages can be 
derived with the python scripts. 

Here is the cam profile for TPA 330 SQ on A3 Compact Flex machine.

Here is the cam profile for TBA 1000 SQ on A3 Flex machine.

## Roadmap

- Inform the industry that this work have been released publicly.
- Fetch the opportunity to check and run on real machines.
- Write a tutorial on how to run these scripts to generate other curves.
- Refactor the codes aiming at the API for customized parameter script.
- Abstract the algorithm as backend of a cam design add-on for FreeCAD.
- Gather more applications of various conditions with high-speed cams.

## Explanation

Tetracamthon - four(**tetra**) coupling **cam**s mechanisms 
with Py**thon** and FreeCAD.
